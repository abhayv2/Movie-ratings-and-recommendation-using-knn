# Movie ratings and recommendation using knn

## Objective

This project aims to build a Movie Recommendation System using collaborative filtering by implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. I will also predict the rating of the given movie based on its neighbors and compare it with the actual rating.
 
## Dataset

Data is extracted from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) and saved locally.
    tmdb_5000_movies.csv: Contains information like the score, title, date_of_release, genres, etc.
    tmdb_5000_credits.csv: Contains information of the cast and crew for each movie.

## Summary

The project aims at developing a system that can recommend similar movies to a given movie and predict the rating of a given movie based on certain features. This is typically useful for users who are looking for new movies to watch, similar to the ones they have previously enjoyed, or are curious about the expected rating of a particular movie.
